# blackjack

In this project I have created a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.
I have used the OOP and class concepts.You can brush up your oop by just looking at the code.

Here are the few points:

I have created a text-based BlackJack game
The game is one player versus an automated dealer.
The player can stand or hit.
The player is able to pick their betting amount.
You can keep track of the player's total money.
player will be alerted by messages of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
